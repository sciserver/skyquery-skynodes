WISE exposures was not constant with time. The probability calculation uses the standard deviation of the
single exposure flux measurements, w?sigp1, as well as the band-to-band flux correlation significance,
q12,q23,q34.  The probability is computed for a band only when there are at least six single-exposure

inadequate data to make a determination of possible variability. Values of 0 through 9 indicate increasing
probabilities of variation. Values of 0 through 5 are most likely not variables. Sources with values of
6 and 7 are likely flux variables, but are the most susceptible to false-positive variability.
Var_flg values greater than 7 have the highest probability of being true flux variables in a band.
