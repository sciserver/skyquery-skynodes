For the galaxy types the ratio of the UV to the optical flux in the rest frame increases from 1 to 5/6 corresponding
to a sequence from early-type to extreme starburst galaxies. Special class 6 represents starburst galaxies with
strong Ly_alpha emission. In case the continuum could be measured suitably, it turned out that the class 6 galaxies also
belong to type 5. </summary>
