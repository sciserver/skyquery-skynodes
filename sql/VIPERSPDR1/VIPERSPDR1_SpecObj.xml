      <summary> The integer part of the flag has the following meaning:

4 a high-confidence, highly secure redshift, based on a high SNR
spectrum and supported by obvious and consistent spectral
features. The confidence level of Flag 4 measurements is estimated
to be 99% secure.
3 also a very secure redshift, comparable in confidence with Flag
4, supported by clear spectral features in the spectrum, but not
necessarily with high SNR.
2 a fairly secure, ~90% confidence redshift measurement, supported
by cross-correlation results, continuum shape and some spectral
features.
9 a redshift based on only one single clear spectral emission
feature.
1 a reasonable redshift measurement, based on weak spectral features
and/or continuum shape, for which there is roughly a 50% chance
that the redshift is  actually wrong.
0 no reliable spectroscopic redshift measurement was
possible. Redshift is set to the conventional value of 9.9999.

Incase of broad emission lines typical of broad line AGN, a prefix of 1
isadded to zflag, i.e.

14 secure AGN with a &gt;95% secure redshift, at least 2 broad lines;
13 secure AGN with good confidence redshift, based on one broad line
and some faint additional feature;
12 a &gt;95% secure redshift measurement, but lines are not
significantly broad, might not be an AGN;
19 secure AGN with one single secure emission line feature, redshift
based on this line only;
11 a tentative redshift measurement, with spectral features not
significantly broad.

Secondobjects in slit get a 2 as prefix to the flag, i.e.

24 a second object with flag 4
23 a second object with flag 3
22 a second object with flag 2
29 a second object with flag 9
21 a second object with flag 1
20 a second object with flag 0

Andsimilarly for BLAGN (214, 213, 212, ...).

Suffixin form of decimal digit has the following meaning:

.5 the spectroscopic redshift is compatible within 1 sigma with
photometric redshift, i.e
zphot_min &lt; zspec &lt; zphot_max
.4 the spectroscopic redshift is compatible with photometric
redshift at the 2 sigma level, i.e.
minvalue &lt; zspec &lt; maxvalue
where
minvalue = min[ zphot-(1+zphot)*0.05, zphot_min ]
maxvalue = max[ zphot+(1+zphot)*0.05, zphot_max ]
and 0.05 is twice the median scatter of the comparison between
spectroscopic and photometric redshifts.
.2 spectroscopic redshift is NOT compatible with photometric
redshift
.1 no photometric redshift available </summary>

      <summary> The Target Sampling Rate is defined as the ratio of the observed objects
overthe number of possible targets: TSR=Nspec/Nparent, where Nspec is
thenumber of detected targets and Nparent is the number of all the
possiblerandom targets.
TSRhas been computed in bins of apparent magnitude to take into account
thepossible dependence of the sampling rate on the clustering of bright
objects(possibly causing slit collision) and the higher fraction of
observedbright objects for which a spectrum has not been extracted (see
Garilliet al. 2013).
TSRand is needed to take into account the fact that not all the
possibletargets can be observed in the single pass strategy adopted in
VIPERS.See Garilli et al. 2013 for details
TSRis = -1 for serendipitous targets (flags 2*.*), and observed objects
notfulfilling the selection criterion for z&gt;0.5 galaxies (i.e. AGN);

magnituderange (i.e. either i&lt;17.5 or i&gt;22.5). </summary>

    <column name="[ssr]">
      <summary> The SSR is defined as the ratio of the galaxies with a successfully
measuredredshift (flag = 2.*,3.*,4.*,9.*) over the total sample of
detectedgalaxies.
SSRis a function of the apparent magnitude (since to bright objects
correspondspectra with high signal-to-noise, from which the redshift
canbe more easily measured), and of redshift (because the spectral
featuresvisible in the observed spectral range can change). Therefore
SSRhas been computed in bins of redshift and apparent magnitude.
SSRis = -1 for stars (z=0.0000), non measured objects (flag 0), low
confidenceredshift measurements (flags 1.*), spectroscopic BLAGN (flags
1*.*),serendipitous targets (flags=2*.*), and hight redshift galaxies
(zspec&gt;3);
SSR= -99 for objects outside the considered area and selection
magnituderange (i.e. either i&lt;17.5 or i&gt;22.5). </summary>
