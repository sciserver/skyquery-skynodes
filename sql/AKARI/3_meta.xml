    <remarks>
      AKARI (Previously known as ASTRO-F or IRIS - InfraRed Imaging Surveyor)
      is the second space mission for infrared astronomy in Japan. AKARI had
      a 68.5cm telescope cooled down to 6K, and observed in the wavelength
      range from 1.7 (near-infrared) to 180 (far-infrared) micrometer.</remarks>

        Bit flags of data quality for N60. A 16 bits flag per band indicating various data condition. In version 1 catalogue three
        bits are used. The first bit (bit0) is used to indicate the CDS sampling mode. The second
        bit (bit1) warns the flux of the band is less than a half of the detection limit, and is not
        reliable. The fourth bit (bit3) tells that the source is possibly false detection due to ‘sidelobe’
        effects (see, Section 7.7). The third bit (bit2) was previously indicated an anomaly
        which does not exist in the current version, and thus is kept unused. Sources with bit1 or
        bit3 = 1 have FQUAL = 2 or less. Other bits are reserved for the future implementation.
        In the text format version the values are expressed in Hexadecimal format.
