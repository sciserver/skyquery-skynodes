      <summary> [0/4] UZC class 0-4. the UZC class is defined as:

0:a "hit", where the GSC and Zwicky objects are separated in position by less than 180", are comparable in brightness as
visually, and there is no other object within the field that could be a Zwicky galaxy.


1:a "hit" with positional difference less than 180", again with a GSC brightness in the vicinity of the Zwicky value.
the field is centered on a GSC "star" rather than on a "nonstar", but there is only one possible Zwicky galaxy nearby,
the field. Thus, index 1 merely indicated that the nearest GSC object to the Zwicky coordinates is a star rather than the
galaxy.


2:a near "hit" with positional difference less than 180". However, there is confusion because there are at least two
with an estimated spread in magnitudes |Δm| within the expected range, either of which could be a Zwicky galaxy.


3:A near "hit" with positional difference less than 180", but with |Δm| outside the expected range, raising suspicions
the match of the GSC object to the Zwicky galaxy.


4:No "hit" at all for a positional difference less than 180", i.e., there is no match for a Zwicky galaxy. </summary>
