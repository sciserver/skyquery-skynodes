The �total magnitude is computed from the number of counts within a �grown� area.
The total area is determined by first filling in any x or y concavities in the isophote
shape and then adding by rings around the object until the area exceeds the detection
area by at least a factor of two. For daughter objects, the total magnitude is divided
