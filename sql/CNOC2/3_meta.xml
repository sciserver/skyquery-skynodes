    <summary> The Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology (CNOC2) Field Galaxy Redshift Survey </summary>
    <remarks>
      The Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology (CNOC2) Field Galaxy Redshift Survey is a spectroscopic/photometric survey of faint galaxies over 1.5 deg2 of sky with a nominal spectroscopic limit of RC~21.5 mag. The survey area contains four widely separated patches on the sky with a total sample of over 6000 redshifts, representing a sampling rate of about 45%. In addition, five-color photometry (in IC, RC, V, B, and U) for a complete sample of approximately 40,000 galaxies to RC~23.0 mag is also available.</remarks>
