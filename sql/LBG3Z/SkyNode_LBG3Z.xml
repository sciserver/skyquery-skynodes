      <summary> Notes on Name. Notes are marked as follows:
a =	"S96-CNN" indicates object names appearing in Steidel et al. (1996ApJ...462L..17S, [SH92] QSO 0000-263 NN in Simbad)
b =	This object is discussed in Macchetto et al. (1993ApJ...404..511M) and Giavalisco et al. (1994A&amp;A...288..103G, 1995ApJ...441L..13G)
c =	Objects discussed in Ellison et al. (2001ApJ...549..770E)
d =	This galaxy was previously known as Q0201-C6 in Pettini et al. (2001ApJ...554..981P) and in Shapley et al. (2001ApJ...562...95S)
o =	Objects observed in the near-IR are indicated with their old designations as in Shapley et al. (2001ApJ...562...95S) (for cross-referencing,
[PKS98] Q0256-000 ANN in Simbad).
e =	Object within central HDF region observed with HST; designation as published in Steidel et al. (1996AJ....112..352S);
f =	Object within central HDF WFPC-2 region; designation as published in Williams et al. (1996AJ....112.1335W);
g =	Redshift from Lowenthal et al. (1997ApJ...481..673L).
h =	For purely historical reasons, a number of objects in this field have been published under slightly different names. For such cases,
the previous designation is given in this column.
i =	This object does not satisfy the LBG color selection criteria, but is of interest because it is near Q1422+2309 on the plan of the
sky and is at close to the same redshift.
j =	Objects whose photometry satisfies our LBG selection criteria, but which have been discussed under alternative names, are indicated
in this column. "S96" refers to Steidel et al. (1996ApJ...462L..17S [SGP96] SSA 22 CNN in Simbad), and "S98" refers to Steidel et al.
(1998ApJ...492..428S, [SAD98] SSA 22a ANN&gt;, &lt;[SAD98] SSA 22a AANN in Simbad). Objects which at one time satisfied our selection criteria,
and which were spectroscopically observed, are included at the end of the table (see appendix of the paper).
k =	This object appeared as a member of the z=3.09 "spike" in Steidel et al. (1998ApJ...492..428S), called "SSA22b-D27". </summary>
