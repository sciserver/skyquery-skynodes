In Her1 and Lynx2, the colors are derived from magnitudes measured in a circular aperture of radius 2 arcsec.
The 5 off-scale values (MKK97= 103357, 103341, 213807, 217739, 316656) reflect the fact that the photometry for individual objects
can be wrong due to plate defects or whatever. They clearly indicate that the photometry in at least one band for that object is questionable. </summary>
