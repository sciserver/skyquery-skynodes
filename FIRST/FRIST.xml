    <column name="[ra]">
      <summary> RA (right ascension, J2000). The accuracy of the position depends on the brightness and size of
the source and the noise in the map. Point sources at the detection limit of the catalog have positions
accurate to better than 1 arcsec at 90% confidence; 2 mJy point sources in regions with typical noise
levels have positions good to 0.5 arcsec. An empirical expression for the positional accuracy is
unc(90% confidence) = Size  (1/SNR + 1/20)  arcsec
where Size is either the major or minor axis fitted FWHM (fMaj or fMin) as given in the catalog and SNR
is the peak flux density signal-to-noise ratio:
SNR = (Fpeak-0.25) / Rms
(The positional uncertainty is of course elliptical for elliptical sources.) The best possible positional
uncertainty is limited to about 0.1 arcsec by our ability to fit source positions in maps with 1.8 arcsec
pixels and by various calibration uncertainties. Systematic errors in the positions are smaller than 0.05 arcsec. </summary>

    <column name="[Ps]">
      <summary> Ps indicates the probability that the source is spurious (most commonly because it is a sidelobe
of a nearby bright source.) Low values mean the source is unlikely to be spurious. Here is the distribution
of Ps values in the catalog:
Probability Range	Fraction of sources
0.00 &lt; PS &lt; 0.05	76.3%

Sidelobe probabilities for this version of the catalog have been computed using an improved algorithm based
on multiple voting oblique decision tree classifiers. The classifiers were trained using deep VLA fields
that give reliable assessments of the reality of FIRST sources. The algorithm will be described in detail
in a future paper on the final FIRST catalog; we believe it is a substantial improvement over the previous
sidelobe flagging approach. Nevertheless, we still recommend checking the images using the FIRST Cutout Server
if there is doubt about the reality of particular sources. This is easily done when using the FIRST Search
Engine to search the catalog, since each source selected in the search has a link to the Cutout Server. </summary>

    <column name="[Fpeak]">
      <summary> Fpeak is the peak flux density measured in mJy. It is derived by fitting an
elliptical Gaussian model to the source. To correct for the "CLEAN bias" effect, 0.25 mJy has been added to
the peak flux density (see our Astrophysical Journal paper and our catalog paper for more details.)
The uncertainty in Fpeak is given by the rms noise at the source position. For bright sources the accuracies of Fpeak is
limited to about 5% by systematic effects. </summary>
<unit>mJy</unit>
</column>
    <column name="[Fint]">
      <summary> Fint is the integrated flux density measured in mJy. It is derived by fitting an
elliptical Gaussian model to the source. To correct for the "CLEAN bias" effect the integrated flux density has been
multiplied by (1+0.25/Fpeak) (see our Astrophysical Journal paper and our catalog paper for more details.)
The uncertainty in Fpeak is given by the rms noise at the source position, while the uncertainty in Fint can be
considerably greater depending on the source size and morphology. For bright sources the accuracies of Fint
are limited to about 5% by systematic effects. Note that for sources that are not well-described by an elliptical Gaussian
model, Fint is not an accurate measure of the integrated flux density. </summary>

</column>
    <column name="[RMS]">
      <summary> Rms is a local noise estimate at the source position measured in mJy. Rms is computed by combining the measured
noise from all grid pointing images contributing to this coadded map position. Note that the significance of detection
for a source is (Fpeak-0.25)/Rms, not Fpeak/Rms, because of the CLEAN bias correction to the peak flux density. The catalog
includes only sources brighter than 5 Rms. </summary>
<unit>mJy</unit>
</column>
    <column name="[Maj]">
      <summary> Maj gives the major axis (FWHM in arcsec)
derived from the elliptical Gaussian model for the source. Maj and Min have been deconvolved to remove blurring by the
elliptical Gaussian point-spread function. (The fitted parameters before deconvolution are given in the fMaj, fMin, and
fPA columns.) In the north the beam is circular 5.4 arcsec FWHM; south of declination +4�33'21", the beam is elliptical,
6.4x5.4 arcsec FWHM, with the major axis running north-south. In the southern Galactic cap (RA = 21hrs to 3hrs), the
elliptical beam size increases further to 6.8x5.4 arcsec south of declination -2�30'25".
Noise can cause the fitted values of the major and minor axes (before deconvolution) to be smaller than the beam.
The corresponding deconvolved size is given as zero in that case.
The uncertainties in the deconvolved sizes depend on both the brightness and the sizes. Objects at the catalog flux
density limit have uncertainties of about 2 arcsec in their sizes (so faint objects with Maj &lt;; 2 arcsec are consistent
with point sources.) A simple empirical estimate of the uncertainty is
Sigma(Size) = 10 arcsec  (1/SNR + 1/75)
where SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio defined above. </summary>

    <column name="[Field]">
      <summary> The Field Name is the name of the coadded image containing the source. Note that the field name encodes the
position of the field center: field hhmmm+ddmmm is centered at RA=hh mm.m, Dec=+dd mm.m. The images are available from
several archives and through the FIRST Cutout Server.
All field names in the current catalog end with a letter E through X, depending on the date of the last catalog release
in which the image was modified. The W and X fields are new in this catalog, while sources extracted from the E-T fields
are essentially identical to those in the previous version of the catalog. The W fields include contributions from EVLA
data taken in Spring 2011 and have both a slightly different central frequency (1.335 GHz instead of 1.400 GHz) and typically
higher noise levels than the older images. The X fields are images that neighbor the EVLA fields but differ from the previous
release in that they omit nearby EVLA observations from the co-adding of overlapping grid images. </summary>

      <summary> The Mean_yr, Mean_MJD and rms_MJD columns give information on the mean epoch of the FIRST flux density measurement. The FIRST survey consists of
3-minute integrations at a grid of points on the sky. But the catalogs are derived from coadded images that use a weighted
sum of the individual pointing maps to achieve nearly uniform sensitivity. (See the FIRST survey paper for more details.)
That means that each measurement is a weighted sum of multiple observations.
The Epoch Mean columns give the weighted mean of all the contributing pointing epochs at the position of the source. It is
given both in decimal years (Mean_yr) and in MJD (Mean_MJD) for convenience. </summary>

That means that each measurement is a weighted sum of multiple observations.The Epoch rms column (rms_MJD) gives the weighted rms of the pointing
epochs at the source position. It is a measure of the spread in epochs that contribute to the measurement. Many sources
have small rms values of only a few minutes (dominated by a single 3-minute pointings or by 2 adjacent pointings), but
values of days to weeks are also common (for sources observed in the overlap between declination strips), and some objects
have rms values of years (for sources observed at the edges of regions in different observing seasons or that were observed
multiple times due to data problems). The largest epoch rms in the survey is 6.8 years.
The epoch rms should be used as a guide to identify objects that do not have well-defined epochs. The table below gives an
indication of the frequency of different epoch rms values in the catalog. Epoch rms range	Fraction
